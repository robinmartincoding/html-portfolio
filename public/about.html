<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Robin Martin, I'm studying to become a full stack developer.
  By accomplishing this, I will have successfully integrated myself into an ever learning, ever evolving  field that demands both logical and creative thinking. 
  Coding can be applied to so many fields of study. Curiosity and the pursuit of progress drives me forward.
  With so many causes I'm interested in, why not develop the skills needed that overlap in said fields?
</p>

<p>I came to the world of coding through my father. 
  He is the one who inspires me to take things apart and analyze the pieces, the one who showed me how much of an adventure the pursuit of knowledge is, and the one that showed me that learning is not just for grades but for real world application.
  So when I found myself in a tough situation with my future, the mind of this engineer saw that coding would be a good solution.
  My Dad found the common thread that is technology, and saw that not only would I be able to make progress in the many areas of interest that I have, but develop an in demand, marketable skill.
</p>

<p>The tough situation I spoke of was ultimately rooted in a need for resilience.
  Resilience is something that I've had to acquire not only to be consistent in my learning of coding, but to overcome my own mind.
  It was made evident to me that the traditional classroom setting would not be a successful way for me to learn.
  So, I bought courses on udemy.com and learned to think like an engineer.
  By taking things apart and by doing.
</p>

<p>The mission of this website is to be a catalog of all the projects I've done and a log of my skill development.
  As I learn more and push onward into new fields, they'll be logged here.
  Consider this a progress tracker, a library of what I've learned, and my workshop.
